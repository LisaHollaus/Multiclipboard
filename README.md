# Multiclipboard-saver

This is a simple program that saves the clipboard to a file and loads it from a file. 
It is useful for saving multiple items to the clipboard and loading them later on, by using a key.


## Usage
1. Run the program in the terminal using 'python main.py' followed by the command:
2. 'save' to save the current clipboard to the file (by key)
3. 'load' to load a given clipboard from the file (accessed by key)
4. 'list' to list the files in the clipboard directory

Optionally add a third argument to specify the key to save or load the clipboard to/from, e.g. 'python main.py save 1' will save the clipboard to the file with key '1'.
